            <h1>Hi there!</h1> <br>
            <p>My name is Venxia. I am currently a high school student, studying NCEA Level 3. Being an NCEA student myself, I know how hard it is to navigate through the curriculum. It can be very challenging and stressful so finding a helping hand is always beneficial.  As my journey with NCEA will be shortly coming to an end, here are some tips & tricks that I found helped ease NCEA stress. Good luck! </p>

                    <h2>What is NCEA?</h2>
                    <p>NCEA stands for National Certificate of Educational Achievement. It is the main national qualification that senior students in secondary schools (in New Zealand) study for. 
                    The qualification can be obtained by studying subjects in NCEA Level 1, 2, and 3 and gaining credits in these subjects. 
                    NCEA is recognised by employers, tertiary institutions in New Zealand as well as overseas. </p>

                    <h2 class="study-spot-h2">Study Spot</h2>
                    <p class="study-spot-para">Having a good study spot is important for focus and comfort whilst studying. Find a place in your home where it is quiet and you can concentrate. Sometimes a change of scenery is also good, so you can try studying in the library or at a friend or family’s house.

                    <h2>Organisation</h2>
                    <p>You should create a plan of when to complete key tasks in a diary/wallchart. It is important to write what these tasks are such as learning formulae, making flashcards or practicing essay writing as well as including when they should be due. By doing this you will be able to relieve the stress of a large workload by being organised and managing your time. </p>

                    <h2 class="app-h2">A useful App</h2>
                    <p class="app-para">Focusing on work even in your study spot can be hard with devices around. That’s why I liked to use the application <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1369320/Virtual_Cottage/" target="_blank">Virtual Cottage</a>. It is a screensaver app that allows you to set a time to complete a task, as well as toggle rain and lofi-beat audio. Its display is also dynamic so changes according to your location. A perfect tool for studying!</p>

                    <h3>Remember relaxation</h3>
                    <p>Be sure to set a time when you can relax. Doing things you enjoy such as music or hanging out is great. Having free time is very important. It can help you relieve stress and it also helps you jump back into your work feeling fresh! </p>

                    <h3 class="wellbeing-h3">Wonderful wellbeing</h3>
                    <p class="wellbeing-para">Remember to take care of yourself. Whilst traversing NCEA is important, taking care of your wellbeing is a priority. Exercising, eating well and getting enough sleep is vital to properly fulfilling your Hauora. Doing these things will be better for NCEA in the long run as you won’t be burnt out as easily. </p>

                    <h3 class="perspective-h3">Perspective</h3>
                    <p class="perspective-para">Last, of all, keep a wide perspective. I’ve had my fair share of failures and I have learnt that it is okay to fail. If you don’t get the mark you want or lose out on credits, it is not the end of the world. There will be other times for success. Don’t stress too hard as whilst NCEA is important, there is a larger life outside of it and any obstacles can be overcome!</p>
